/**
 * exception.log is always parsed for its own distilled "Recent exceptions" list and
 * trackable occurrence count, regardless of admin configuration - that behavior is specific
 * to this one file's content, not something an admin can switch off. Which other files get a
 * raw recent-lines tail is admin-controlled via System Configuration > Advanced > StackGauge
 * > Agent > "Monitored Log Files" (see Config::getMonitoredLogFiles()).
 *
 * Every run reads only the bytes appended to a file since this reporter last looked at it,
 * via a byte offset persisted per file name in LogOffsetStore - the first time a file is seen
 * (or after it's been rotated/truncated, detected by the stored offset exceeding the file's
 * current size) it's read from byte 0, exactly like every run used to behave. A real
 * exception.log on a long-running store can reach hundreds of MB; rereading it whole on every
 * run reliably exhausted PHP-FPM's memory_limit (CLI/cron kept working throughout, which is
 * why this only ever surfaced via the admin "Send Now" button) and, even memory-safe, wasted
 * I/O that grew with the file's lifetime size rather than with how much was actually new.
 *
 * One consequence of reading only what's new: "recent exceptions" and each monitored file's
 * line tail show what appeared since the last run, not a constant rehash of the same
 * historical lines every time - they can be empty on a quiet run, which just means nothing
 * new happened, not that collection stopped. exception.log's own occurrence count is the one
 * value that still needs to read as a stable running total (see getTrackableMetrics() -
 * AGGREGATION_DELTA expects a monotonically growing counter) - LogOffsetStore carries that
 * total forward across runs by storing it alongside the byte offset, so accurate as a single
 * full scan today, this reporter just adds each run's newly-found count to it instead of
 * recomputing the whole thing from scratch.
